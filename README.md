# Homebridge ISY

Note: The npm package has been changed to [homebridge-ISY](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-isy) (ISY API lib is now called [isy-nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isy-nodejs))

# Major Updates

Requires [Homebridge v1.0+](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge). Please see revised installation notes below.

### New Functionality

- Support for ISY 5.0.16+

- Installable & Configurable using [Homebridge Config-UI X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x) ***WORKS as of RC3***

- NEW: Configurable device naming convention (See sample config below).

  You can now configure how the device name should be passed to its corresponding Accessory (using javascript string interpolation syntax). For example, if "${location ?? folder} ${spokenName : name}" is provided to the config, all devices will be named according to the convention, location unless blank, then folder + spoken name, unless blank, then name.

- Pulls folders and notes from ISY

  1. Default behavior is that folder names will be appended to the device name e.g. if "Vent Switch" is in folder "Bathroom", the display name passed to homebridge will be Bathroom Switch Vent.
  2. If notes are in the ISY and have been populated fully, location and spoken name will be used to render the display name. E.g. if Bathroom.Switch.Vent has been updated with Bathroom as the Location and Vent as the spoken name, then Bathroom Vent will be used as the display name.

- Additional parameters available to filter devices (Device Family (e.g. Insteon, Zigbee, ZWave, etc...), Folder (ref. above), ISY Type Code (e.g. 15.1.1.1) and NodeDef (KeypadButton_ADV) if you want to use either NodeDef or Type Code please let me know)

- Global Renames - i.e. replace any instance of '.' with ' ' -> Switch.Vent -> Switch Vent or remove any instance of certain words e.g. Bathroom.Switch.Vent -> Bathroom Vent... see config sample below

- Support for additional devices (Need Testers):
  Insteon Thermostat/Thermostat Adapters
  Leak Sensors
  CO/Smoke Bridges (WIP)
  Remotes

### Bug Fixes/Under the hood:

- Uses more robust handling for device status changes from ISY and sending updates to ISY (e.g. using updateCharacteristic vs. setCharacteristic to not fire events)
- Migrated to typescript
- Upgraded to use latest version of hap-nodejs (requires homebridge-beta).

### TODO:

- Re-add support for non-insteon/elk native devices (ZWave & Zigbee)
- Test garage door openers & MorningLinc locks (Need Testers)
- Add support for Zigbee Devices
- Add Keypad Button support (Keypad Buttons will map to Stateless Programmable Switches)
- Incorporate individual device status in scene definitions
- Create configurable mappings for IOLinc to other types of accessories (e.g. curtains, sprinkler control & garage door openers)

### Future Work:

- Add NodeServer support. May implement or may implement in ISY-nodejs only, as using native homebridge plugins may be better solution. E.g. for nest devices, you would use a Nest NodeServer to integrate with the ISY, and the Nest homebridge plugin to integrate with HomeKit.

## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge@beta
2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-isy
3. Update your configuration file. See sampleconfig.json in this repository for a sample. Please note that the platform name has been changed to "ISY".

IMPORTANT NOTE: Since the package and platform names are different (and the way accessory IDs are assigned), you can have both original version [homebridge-isy-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-isy-js) and homebridge-isy installed (you will have two platform sections (one ISY and the other isy-js) your homebridge config). this is something I recommend if you have a lot of devices configured currently, and anything like the garage door opener/locks/elk that need to be tested. This way, you can wait to uninstall the old version once you've got everything configured and working correctly.

## Requirements

Only the ISY 994 and newer devices running 5.0.16+ are supported. The ISY 99i device is no longer supported as this library depends on a later version of the REST/Websocket interface.

## Implementation Notes

- Scenes will not show as on until all light devices are on. This allows the UI to send an 'on' request to light up the r√üest of them.
- Garage door openers (in this case an I/O Linc used in a garage kit) are complex to get correct. We only have the current state of the contact
  sensor to determine current status. In particular, if you startup the system while the garage door is changing state (opening or closing)
  the code will likely get the state incorrect. If you get into this state, close the garage door and restart homebridge. The garage door is assumed open at startup and closed at startup if the contact sensor
  says the door is open or closed respectively.

# History

- 0.2.0 - Development resumed.
  - Support for v5.0.12+
  - Support for Insteon Thermostat/Insteon Thermostat Adapter added
  - Fixed characteristic update logic to capture externally initiated changes w/o triggering update back to isy.
  - Requires new version of [isy-js](https://github.com/pradeepmouli/isy-js.git)
- 0.1.9 - (Rodtoll) Active development ended.
- 0.1.8 - Fixed crash in tests (race condition) and fixed crash in garage door device.
- 0.1.7 - Fixed crash when there is no ignoreDevices entry. Also added new renameDevices section to enable device renaming. Added note to highlight ISY 99 is no longer supported, you needed an ISY 994 or newer. Added checks to ensure device list doesn't exceed 100 devices. Simplified ignore syntax so blank elements no longer needed.
- 0.1.6 - Addressed crash when identify called on lights.
- 0.1.4 - Release for testing alternative garage logic. No change for anyone wanting to use it with the standard logic.
- 0.1.3 - Added improved debug output. Fixed bug where plugin would crash when there are no garage door opener present.
- 0.1.2 - Added garage door opener support
- Previous - Changes not tracked in this document.
